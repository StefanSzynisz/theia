Matlab YAML library

This package contains Matlab class to serialize/decode matlab object in
yaml format. The software uses SnakeYAML java class to convert yaml to
java object and then translates it into Matlab object.

Usage
-----

Make sure YAML.m is in your matlab path.

To serialize matlab object:

  >> X = struct('matrix', rand(3,4), 'char', 'hello');
  >> S = YAML.dump(X);
  >> disp(S);
  matrix:
  - [0.9571669482429456, 0.14188633862721534]
  - [0.4853756487228412, 0.421761282626275]
  - [0.8002804688888001, 0.9157355251890671]
  char: hello

To decode yaml string:

  >> X = YAML.load(S);
  >> disp(X)
    matrix: [3x2 double]
      char: 'hello'

The YAML class also has convenient YAML.read(filepath) and YAML.write(filepath,X) methods to directly import from/export to a file.

YAML.write('/path/to/your.yml', X); % save X to a yaml file
X = YAML.read('/path/to/your.yml'); % load X from a yaml file
Check help YAML for detail.

Note: If you are looking for how to read OpenCV YAML files, check cv.FileStorage function in mexopencv.

Limitation
----------
 * Currently the software doesn't support N-D array.
 * Due to the multiple ways to represent an array in Matlab (i.e., numeric
   array, cell array, or struct array), it is not possible to represent
   everything in compatible format. The software converts cell array of
   numbers or struct to numeric array or struct array when possible.
